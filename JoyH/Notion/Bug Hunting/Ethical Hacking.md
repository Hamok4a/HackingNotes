what is ethical hacking ?  we can say that ethical hacking is the type of hacking which is nearly a clean hack  which means it is legal  not like the normal hacking which is not legal as  in ethical hacking there is many types  of hackers  or places to work in ethical hacking there many types of (hats) there is  a white hat  , black hat   and grey hat  . but , what is the difference between  each of them ?  the   Grey hat is  a mix between each of the  black hat and the white hat  and  the white hat is  the hacker that works as an ethical hacker for a company that will pay him to hack there company and this is called pentesting  and pentesting contains many fields that are big and very big there are fields that are like web app pentesting and also network pentesting  , pentesting  can happen for things like  software  and also hardware things  pentesters are very clever and hardworker  they put alot of there time in  there work they keep learning till they die but they are happy by what they are doing   , but  and as we are still talking about  white hat ethical hacker  so we will also discuss the black hat    which is  what is known as a hacker in our normal community that a hacker is a hijacker a thief who steal things like data  , informations , money  and also   doing things like destroying people and even leading into killing them if you connected with a killer  you can also make people suicide there self if you destroyed there life by doing things like  spreading something about them with a prove you got from hacking  . about the hats we know talked about white and black we also have grey  and the grey hat is a  normal hacker that works in both the good and bad  fields of hackers  fields . 
what is pen-testing ? its a an appreviation for penetration testing and it is my field of study right now  i am now solving  labs and CTFS about pentesting but what is pentesting ?  it is me for example a hacker who is  still learning but as we said we dont stop learning till death as technology never stops upgradding and updating  so for example as i said me  a pentester  i get payed  from a company  to pentest it but what does this means ?  they give me money to litteraly  attack the company  and try to search for vulnerabilities and if i found any of them i tell the company that i found the vulnerabliity and  i can be called something like a red teamer   and the  company will take my report of the vulnerability and the security of the company as whole and as each part i found vulnerable and then they give it to the  blue team that will take it and  do the  modification on the source code to fix the vulnerability and find a solution for it  so for example if a company have a website and this website while i was studying the requests i found a paramter that its own value get reflected on the website's response so then i can exploit it farther and check if it contains an XSS vulnerabitiy cross-site request vulnerability which results from  bad input sanitization  from the website's server   which is  going to lead into many big things like  bitcoin mining in the  targeted device without even knowing that the device is doing that and thins like  and js code  that can be  executed here  and things like leading if combined with something like a CSRF to things like changing the users credentials and more and more     or if the website is containing a file upload  function we can do things like file upload attacks we can  like    getting by it to RCE  in the system's server  by doing something like uploading  a maliciouse file.php and then trying to execute that file of php by just viewing it in the website  if we are doing something like attacking a profile picture  functionallity so if we bypassed it and uploaded .php file we will see   where is our uploaded files should be stored and if our uploaded file is something like  `<?php system($_REQUEST['command']); ?>`  we then will  give in the link for our php file the value of the parameter command in our GET link request  and get is a http method    that makes us put values for variables in our link instead of the reqeusts body as what happens in POST  so thats  what we got at the end  to  that we in the place of the value we can put command to execute them   and then do thing like ( pwd , cat etc/passwd) 
and more and more like we already have the whole server under our control and if we are pentesting then we will report this vulenrability  and that it .
