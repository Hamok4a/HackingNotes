# Concept: 

- social media account  sign up or log in with it is usually build using the OAuth 2.0  framework .

![[OAuth 2.0 authentication vulnerability-20231212080355811.webp]]
 - OAuth is commonly used authorization framework that enables websites and web applications to request limited access to a user's account on another application . crucially , OAuth allows  the user to grant this access without exposing their login credentials to the requesting application . 
 - so it is preventing the requester application from getting the credentials passed through it  by just  making the social application produce  an access token after sign in it  , with  this access token you can access the targeted website . 
 - the targeted website is the third party here so we are trying not to give our credentials  to any third party . 
 - client application is the client provider that provides the  resource owner (client) with the website and data they are trying to access   and we of course have the OAuth 2.0 service provider : which is the website or application  that controls the user's data and access  to it . they support OAuth  by providing an API for interacting with both an authorization server and  a resource server .
 - ( they provide an API  for interacting both an authorization server and a resource server )
# we have two OAuth grant types
for any of OAuth grant type the client application has to specify which  scope it is targeting to get to the user from his own  social account : 
```
scope=contacts 
scope=contacts.read
scope=contacts-list-r
scope=https://oauth-authorization-server.com/auth/scopes/user/contacts.readonly 
```

OPEN ID profile will grant the client application read access to a predefined set of basic information about the user, such as their email address , username . 
but what is OPEN ID connect ?

1. user choose log in with their social media account
2. client provider (website) asks the account website  for some data ( ex: email )
3. after receiving an access token from the client application requests the data from the resource server, typical from a dedicated /userinfo endpoint so -> we are depending also on the API to  get our OAuth  working as we said before we need to access the API at the end of the  OAuth  we are going to use  once ti has received the data, the client application uses it in place of a username to log the user in . the access token that it received from the authorization server  often used instead of
