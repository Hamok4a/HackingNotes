### Explanation: Cross-Origin Loading and SOP

The Same-Origin Policy (SOP) allows certain types of resources to be loaded from different origins, but it restricts the ability of JavaScript to interact with the content of these resources. Here's what this means:

#### Cross-Origin Loading Permitted

- **Images (`<img>` tag):**
    - You can include images from any origin in your webpage.
    - Example: `<img src="http://other-website.com/image.jpg">`
- **Media (`<video>` or `<audio>` tags):**
    - You can embed video or audio files from other origins.
    - Example: `<video src="http://other-website.com/video.mp4"></video>`
- **Scripts (`<script>` tag):**
    - You can include and execute JavaScript files from other origins.
    - Example: `<script src="http://other-website.com/script.js"></script>`

#### Restrictions on JavaScript Interaction

- While these external resources can be loaded and used by the webpage, the JavaScript running on the webpage is restricted in terms of what it can do with the content of these resources.
- **Example Scenarios:**
    - **Images:** You can display an image from another origin on your site, but your JavaScript cannot access the image data (e.g., get pixel data from a canvas rendering of the image).
    - **Media:** You can play a video or audio file from another origin, but your JavaScript cannot manipulate or access the media's raw data.
    - **Scripts:** You can include and run a script from another origin, but if that script tries to interact with resources that follow the SOP, those interactions will be subject to the same-origin policy.

#### Practical Implications

- This means that resources from different origins can be used to enhance the functionality and content of a website, but the security boundary enforced by SOP ensures that a malicious script cannot read sensitive data from these external resources.
- **Security Benefit:** Prevents cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks where malicious scripts could potentially steal data by accessing the content of external resources.

#### Example Use Case:

1. **Including an Image:**
    
    html
    

- `<img src="http://other-website.com/image.jpg">`
    
    - The image is displayed on your site, but your JavaScript cannot read the image's pixel data.
- **Including a Script:**
    
    html
    

`<script src="http://other-website.com/script.js"></script>`

- The script executes in the context of your site, but it cannot access data from another origin directly.
