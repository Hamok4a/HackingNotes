# what is ai ?
ai is *Artificial intelligence* the ability of a digital computer or 
computer-controlled robot to perform tasks that are commonly associated with 
intelligent beings. 
Today, the term “AI” describes a wide range of technologies that power many of 
the services and goods we use every day – from apps that recommend tv shows to 
chatbots that provide customer support in real time. But do all of these really 
constitute artificial intelligence as most of us envision it? And if not, then 
why do we use the term so often?
In this article, We’ll learn more about artificial intelligence, what it 
actually does, and different types of it. In the end, We ’ll also learn about 
some of its benefits and dangers and explore flexible courses that can help you 
expand your knowledge of AI even further.
# how can we use ai ?
the *Artificial intelligence is a very important technology nowadays* The 
term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with 
the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning,
generalize, or learn from past experience. Since the development of the digital
computer in the 1940s, 
Man is the one who invented artificial intelligence. There are a number of 
different forms of learning as applied to artificial intelligence. The simplest 
is learning by trial and error. For example, a simple computer program for 
solving mate-in-one chess problems might try moves at random until mate is 
found.
# is ai dangerous ?
is ai dangerous? ai well be dangerous if we use it by bad way like fighting, 
hacking and, Harmful to humans but, It is used for useful purposes 
# intelligence:
All but the simplest human behaviour is described to intelligence, while even 
the most complicated insect behavior is usually not taken as an indication of 
intelligence. What is the difference? Consider the behavior of the 
digger wasp, Sphex ichneumons. When the female wasp returns to her burrow with
food, she first deposits it on the threshold), checks for intruders inside her 
burrow, and only then, if the coast is clear, carries her food inside. the 
intelligence a small example from human behavior. 
# *What is artificial general intelligence (AGI)?*
General artificial intelligence (AGI) is a branch of theoretical artificial 
intelligence research that develops artificial intelligence for a human level of
cognitive function, including the ability to self-learn. refers to a theoretical
state in which computer systems will be able to achieve or exceed human 
intelligence. In other words, AGI is “true” artificial intelligence as depicted 
in countless science fiction novels, television shows, movies, and comics.
# General information about AI :
we can also say that ai is very important in our life as it helps in increasing 
the production without increasing the cost it also prevent the company from 
wasting a lot of time and money but how does it do that ? it do decrease the
amount of money paid by things like decreasing the amount of employers in the
company as if the company has something it can do without the employers it 
will do it via AI and also it see what task does the company is doing 
repeatedly so if the company is doing for example something like closing the 
bottles so it will use ai instead of putting an employer to do something like 
that this also has another advantage as we can say that the employer is also 
a human so he will need to take rests and also take time that he will decrease
his amount of work that he do and also the quality of his work in the work he 
is doing and also the employer can be harmed emotionally and then harm other
employees and also harm the customers he is surving so for something like 
that we cna put other things than human which in our case is the ai as 
robots and machines so we will do things like that and of course you now know 
the advantages of something like that in any company and also humans will work
for about eight hours and maybe some of them works more but of course the 
quality will decrease but in the otherhand ai is not going to take the same 
amount of time and waste that tim eandn the quality of the work will stay the 
same as high as the programmer and engineer made the robot so that it has 
really amount of advantages but at the other hand we can say that there is 
alot of error that may happens so for example we can remeber from a couple fo 
weeks a robot in some country were working with a normal human in the country 
at the ssame company and then suddenly the robot killed the man but hwo , this
happend by an accident the robot was designed to destroy boxes but the robot 
loooked at the human who were working with him and thought that it is also a 
robot so he did caught him and then he killed him .
